			<p>
			Hi, meet Jimmy. Jimmy needs to collect stars, but he's allergic to bugs and he really hates water! Use the keyboard arrows to guide Jimmy to the star. When he reaches the star Jimmy will be transported back to the starting area so he can collect another star. Avoid both the bugs and water, and be careful; the nasty bugs get faster as you take more of their stars! <br>The game will reset if Jimmy gets hit by a bug or if he hits the water.
